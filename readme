# Setting Up SSH to Access VPS

To set up SSH to access your VPS, follow these steps:

## 1. Generate SSH Key Pair

Open a terminal and run the following command to generate a new SSH key pair:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Follow the prompts to save the key pair in the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) and set a passphrase if desired.

## 2. Copy Public Key to VPS

Use the `ssh-copy-id` command to copy your public key to the VPS. Replace `username` and `vps_ip_address` with your VPS username and IP address:

```sh
ssh-copy-id username@vps_ip_address
```

If `ssh-copy-id` is not available, you can manually copy the public key:

```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh username@vps_ip_address "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

## 3. Test SSH Connection

Test the SSH connection to ensure everything is set up correctly:

```sh
ssh username@vps_ip_address
```

You should be able to log in without being prompted for a password.

## 4. (Optional) Configure SSH Config File

To simplify the SSH command, you can configure the SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`):

```sh
Host my-vps
    HostName vps_ip_address
    User username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Now you can connect to your VPS using:

```sh
ssh my-vps
```

That's it! You have successfully set up SSH to access your VPS.
