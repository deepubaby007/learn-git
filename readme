    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
    sudo sh get-docker.sh
    ```

3. **Install Docker Compose:**
    Coolify also requires Docker Compose. Install it using the following commands:

    ```sh
    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | grep -Po '"tag_name": "\K.*\d')" /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```

4. **Clone Coolify repository:**
    Clone the Coolify repository from GitHub.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify.git
    cd coolify
    ```

5. **Create environment file:**
    Create a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables. You can use the provided example file as a template.

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

6. **Start Coolify:**
    Use Docker Compose to start Coolify.

    ```sh
    sudo docker-compose up -d
    ```

7. **Access Coolify:**
    Once Coolify is running, you can access it via your VPS's IP address on port 3000.

That's it! You should now have Coolify running on your VPS.
